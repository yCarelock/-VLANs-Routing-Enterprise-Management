# -VLANs-Routing-Enterprise-Management(Cisco Packet Tracer)

Overview

Designed and implemented a segmented enterprise network in Cisco Packet Tracer to reinforce Network+ and CCNA-aligned networking fundamentals, with a focus on real-world troubleshooting and verification rather than scripted success.
